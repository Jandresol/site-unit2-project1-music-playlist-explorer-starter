## Unit Assignment: Music Playlist Explorer

Submitted by: **Jasmine Andresol**

Estimated time spent: **12** hours spent in total

**Important Note:**
The deployed application has issues with loading the song playlists as well as shaving functional play buttons as the APIs are not integrated within github pages.

Deployed Application (**required**): [Music Playlist Explorer Deployed Site](https://jandresol.github.io/site-unit2-project1-music-playlist-explorer-starter/music-playlist-creator/index.html)

    - [x] If previously unliked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should increase by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been liked by the user.
    - [x] If previously liked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should decrease by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please film yourself liking and unliking:
      - [x] a playlist with a like count of 0
      - [x] a playlist with a non-zero like count

- [x] **Shuffle Songs**
  - [x] Enable users to shuffle the songs within a playlist using a shuffle button in the playlist's detail modal.
  - [x] When the shuffle button is clicked, the playlist's songs should display in a different order.

  - [x] When the page is refreshed or reloaded, a new random playlist is displayed
    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

      - **Note:** You will not be graded on the implementation of this optional subfeature to keep your grade of this stretch feature independent of your implementation of other stretch features. However, we highly suggest including this in your implementation to model realistic behavior of real applications.

    - [x] Name (A-Z alphabetically)
    - [x] Number of likes (descending order)

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Lesson 1 and 2 were great for introducing us to JavaScript and the DOM model. Prior to this, I wasn't the most comfortable with JavaScript. Lesson 3, where we discussed how to fetch and configure APIs through get requests were the most helpful in making the website functional. The in class demo was the most helpful as it gave great boiler plate code on how to integrate the frontend with the json file.

I had a lot of trouble with understanding the HTTP get requests and handing the timing of actions, such as whether or not to use async or await. I also had issues with some functionality that were not loading, so I had to fix it by experimenting with the scope of some functions. For the stretch features, I relied a lot on external sources, I think in the future taking the time to see if I can rely less on documentation and video tutorials for some of the code.


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have spent more time planning out my javascript, specifically focusing on reusability of functions and best practices for the design and implementation of my code. I found that for instance the edit and add modal functionality was redundant, so maybe finding a way to better structure those functions. In terms of additional features, I would have improved music playback features and ensured that the music played on click. As a stretch I would have added different user profiles.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I felt that I was nervous in presenting. In the project demo, my spotify API request timed out, as it only lasts for an hour, so none of the playlist songs were showing, so I had to regenerate the key on the spot. Using npm will make things a lot easier as I can use the SpotifySDK to work through those issues. I noticed that two of my teammates were able to get music playing, which is something I aspired to acheive. I think not getting too stuck on specific features, and looking at the big picture of the project would have helped me for the future, for instance I had a lot of trouble wrangling with the API which could have led to time spent elsewhere.

### Open-source libraries used

I used the Spotify API to load song images, song durations and album names.

### Shout out

Thank you to Lucia, Keith and Alex for helping me work through some of my issues and giving me pointers on how to design some of the features
